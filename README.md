# MedPal-Lightweight-Medical-Enquiry-Chatbot
This repository hosts the development, fine-tuning, clinical evaluation, and guard-railing of Med‑Pal—a lightweight (≤7B parameters) medication‑domain LLM chatbot based on Mistral‑7B, designed for patient‑friendly medication enquiries in digital health. It includes expert‑curated datasets, uses the SCORE framework for assessing safety, accuracy, bias, reproducibility, and clarity, and compares Med‑Pal’s performance to Biomistral and Meerkat.

A small sample of the fine-tuning dataset is included in this repository as MedPal_FineTuning_Data_Sample.xlsx. This sample demonstrates the structure, formatting, and annotation schema used for Med-Pal’s training, including medication-related questions, reference answers, and evaluation labels aligned with the SCORE framework. The full dataset is not publicly released due to privacy and licensing constraints.
